# um-profiling

  UM-Profiling respository contains implementation of a simple universal machine. 
  There is also an optimized version of the universal machine, in which the goal
  was to make the program run as quickly as possible. Profiling tools, such as
  kcachegrind and timers were used for performance analysis

               documenting all changes made to the original universal machine 
               code in order to improve runtime of the program.
